/// UpdateDifficulty updates the program's global difficulty value. Its responsibilities include:
/// 1. Update the mining difficulty.
///
/// Safety requirements:
/// - Can only succeed if the signer is the program admin.
/// - Can only succeed if the provided treasury is valid.
///
/// Discussion:
/// - Mars subdivides into 1 billion indivisible atomic units. Therefore if global hashpower
///   were to increase to the point where >10B valid hashes were submitted to the protocol for
///   validation per epoch, the Mars inflation rate could be pushed above the 10 MARS / min target.
/// - The strict limits on bus reward counters guarantee inflation can never exceed 20 MARS / min,
///   but it is the responsibility of the admin to adjust mining difficulty if needed to maintain
///   the 10 MARS / min target average.
/// - It is worth noting that Solana today processes well below 1 million real TPS or
///   (60 * 1,000,000) = 60,000,000 transactions per minute. Even if every transaction on Solana
///   were a mine operation, this would still be two orders of magnitude below the boundary
///   condition where Mars inflation targets would be challenged. So in practice, Solana is likely
///   to reach its network saturation point long before Mars ever hits its theoretical limits.
