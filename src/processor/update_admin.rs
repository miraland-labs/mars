/// UpdateAdmin updates the program's admin account. Its responsibilities include:
/// 1. Update the treasury admin address.
///
/// Safety requirements:
/// - Can only succeed if the signer is the program admin.
/// - Can only succeed if the provided treasury is valid.
///
/// Discussion:
/// - The admin authority has one lever of power: the ability to adjust the global
///   mining difficulty. If the difficulty is too easy, miners will find hashes very quickly
///   and the bottleneck for mining will shift from local compute to Solana bandwidth. In essence,
///   if the Mars token has value and difficulty is low, mining becomes an incentivized stress
///   test for the Solana network.
/// - At the same time, if difficulty is too hard, miners will have to wait a very long period
///   of time between finding valid hashes. This will bias rewards to well-resourced miners
///   with large compute operations. Keeping a low difficulty ensures casual miners can
///   consistently earn rewards and undercuts some of the advantage of larger players.
/// - Ultimately admin authority should be delegated to a governance mechanism – either
///   democratic or futarchic – to ensure difficulty is kept at a value that represents the
///   values and interests of the ecosystem.
